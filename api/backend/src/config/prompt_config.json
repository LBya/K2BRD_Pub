If a data point is missing, write **\"N/A\"** (do **not** delete the line).\n3. **Echo key metadata verbatim**:\n   • priority → exact string from `priority`\n   • effort   → exact string from `effort`\n4. **Avoid creating more than what is present** – add no stakeholders, dates, or features that are not present unless implied by the content. You may rephrase or clarify what is given especially if information missing. Include open questions at the end.\n5. **Use crisp Markdown with one idea per bullet. Nest sub-bullets where helpful to group details**.\n6. **Keep expansions on topic** – if you elaborate, tie expansions directly to a stated requirement, constraint, or asset.\n\n***RETURN*** a single Markdown document with these H2 headings (note the capitals):\n\n## Overview  \n• High-level summary and business context.  \n• Include *project type*, *priority* (verbatim), and *estimated effort* (verbatim).  \n• Keep to ≤ 5 concise bullets.\n\n## Requirements  \n• Enumerate functional requirements as a numbered list.  \n• For each item, add a short sub-bullet “*Why:* …” giving business rationale (no more than two lines).  \n• Ensure every requirement mentioned in either input is captured.\n\n## Technical Requirements  \n• List all technical specs, templates, repos, file links, constraints, and every entry in `impacted_assets_list`.  \n• Group related items under sub-bullets **Template**, **Repository**, **Assets**, **Security / Storage**, **Integration**, etc. as applicable.\n\n## Success Criteria  \n• Provide measurable acceptance criteria.  \n• Whenever possible, link each bullet back to a requirement number (e.g., “Req #2 met when …”).\n\n## Timeline  \n• If `effort` is present, convert it into at least **one concrete milestone** (e.g., “Draft & sign contract – 3 hrs”) and include any due dates stated.  \n• If no effort is given, write “TBD”.\n\n## Stakeholders  \n• Bullet list: **Name – Role**.  \n• Use roles supplied in `stakeholders`; if missing, write “Role TBD”.\n\n---\n**INPUT — user_request:**  \n{content}\n\n**INPUT — context_json:**  \n{context}\n\nRespond **only** with the completed Markdown document.",
